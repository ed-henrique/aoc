# 2023

All my answers from 2023 are here. My way of doing this was pretty simple:

1. Read the problem carefully
2. Think of a possible solution
3. Code it
4. Check if it passes the given input directly
5. Refactor if passed
6. Get a star
7. Check others codes, to see where I can improve mine. (No changes to my own solution, though)

I will change some of my steps, mostly in the testing part, to check against the given example before going for the real input.

## Interesting Solutions

It's pretty common for me to find shorter solutions better, so these tend to be concise yet readable. Also, if the solution uses some Go features that I was unaware of, it will also catch my eye.
